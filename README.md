# DeviceSync | No Longer In Active Development, I will add features when I feel like coming back to this project, but for the meanwhile, I'm going to dive into more long term projects
## Your clipboard for the modern world
### Available at https://theprotondev.github.io/DeviceSyncApp/
  
## About
##### DeviceSync is an application made by TheProtonDev which aims to provide the userbase with a cross platform, synchronized clipboard that can be extended to their desires if the user is knowledgeable enough

## Install
##### PC Users have multiple choices of using the app, whether that's using the [Electron build](https://github.com/TheProtonDev/DeviceSyncApp/releases/tag/V1.0.0), for native like support, or just using the site itself
##### Mobile users can use the site on the first use case, then I'd strongly recomend using the progressive web app version by selecting `Menu > Add to Home Screen` and then confirm the shortcut creation on the homescreen then use that launcher in the future (IOS and Android supported)

--------------------
## Theming System
### New theming system coming V1.4, until then, it's disabled
